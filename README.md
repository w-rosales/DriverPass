# DriverPass
**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The client, DriverPass is wanting to create a system that is able to offer their customers with online courses, practice tests, on-the-road training, and a scheduling system to practice for driving exams. They want this to be accessible as a an online application with some properties being accessible offline. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

Making sure the requirements from the interview are met is something I did well in. There are several different roles that are introduced into the DriverPass system and they all have significant roles. I was also able to show in diagrams how error handling would happen and how some of the users of the system would be able to interact, given their permissions. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I believe that the diagrams that I made could have been in much more detail. I also believe that color coordination for these diagrams would be an additional feature that would increase legibility. In the end, these diagrams are intended for both the development team and the client to understand the process that are going into their new system. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Thankfully the DriverPass interview that was performed was very in-depth. We were able to get a scheduling block from it, responsibilities for each role, and the features that were to be included. In the first part of the project, we were able to visual the scheduling block by using a GANTT Chart. Here we use the GANTT Chart to color code the stages of development and the time frames for each objective. It is very important to consider the user's needs because in the end, it is their program not our own. We must find ways to implement their features and also make it productive. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I really enjoyed using LucidChart to making all of the templates and diagrams for the project. It was a great way to break down the project piece by piece in order to focus on a smaller number of tasks at a time. The GANTT Chart served as the most significant for myself. I was able to make a chart that is easy to understand for both the development team and the team at DriverPass. I would also implement the activity and sequence diagrams much more into future systems. These two diagrams helped break down the process that are needed for a certain tasks and how different actors in the system will communicate information with each other.
